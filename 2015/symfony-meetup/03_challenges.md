# Challenges

^

## General
- Time limit
- Lack of business logic knowledge
- Can't break working application
- Lack of experience

Note: 
**General** We can't break the application, Ned to constantly deliver value

**Time Limit** People do not really know how much time it will take and it always takes longer than we think

**Business Logic** No regression/behavioral tests, lack of QA, nobody remembers how it should work

**Can not break** Everybody says yes, we understand there will be bugs but reality is, they don't want them 

**Experience** No experience to be able to tell how many things won't work as you expect and new things can not be really predicted

## Technical
- Legacy application is complex
- Lack of skills
- Lack of experience
- Legacy code poor code quality
- No Unit test/not testable code

Note:
**general** We call it legacy for a reason

**Complex** Both technical and not, this is the technical part, messy code, complex logic/design

**Lack of experience** technical point of view, no experience od this operation, no experience on the tool

**Code quality** related to complex application as well
